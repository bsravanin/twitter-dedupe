twitter-dedupe
==============

This was a project taken up during two courses, one on Cloud Computing and
another on NLP. The idea is to cluster similar tweets in a timeline (or any
Twitter stream) because that allows a more contextual view and can also decrease
the noise by eliminating duplicate or nearly identical tweets.

The project wasn't well-maintained and wasn't intended to be long-term. This
repository was used more as a backup.

The backend works fine, especially the core scripts which can be run by passing
a file of tweets through command-line. The frontend, supposed to be for a
website, is a mess.
